# C# Multidimensional Arrays

This repository contains my practice programs using **multidimensional arrays** in C#.

## About
These exercises help me understand how to:
- Declare and initialize 2D and 3D arrays
- Use loops to store and display data
- Work with nested loops
- Perform calculations using array elements

## Examples
- 2D array to store student marks
- Multiplication table using a 2D array
- 3D array demo with nested loops

## Tools
- C#
- Visual Studio

## Next Topics
After this, Iâ€™ll upload new repositories for:
- **Inheritance**
- **Composition**
- **Bubble sort algorithm**
- **Binary search algorithm**
